		<p>Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege is a tactical shooter video game developed by Ubisoft Montreal and published by Ubisoft. It was released worldwide
		on December 1, 2015, for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The game puts heavy emphasis on environmental destruction and cooperation between players. Players assume control of an attacker or a defender in different gameplay modes such as hostage,rescuing and bomb defusing. The title has no campaign, but features a series of short missions that can be played solo. These missions have a loose narrative, focusing on recruits going through training to prepare them for future encounters with the White Masks, a terrorist group that threatens the safety of the world.
		In ranked play, when a round begins, the attackers choose one of several spawn points from which to launch their attack. The attackers are then given control over wheeled drones to scout the map in search of enemy operators and targets, while the defenders can use security cameras to spot the attackers.Maps in the game are designed to encourage close quarters combat, and players cannot respawn until the end of a round. Defenders can also put up destructible barricades and reinforce walls to make them indestructible unless you have an appropriate operator. Players who were killed by opponents can enter Support Mode, which allows them to gain access to drone's cameras and security cameras so that they can continue to contribute to their team by informing them of opponent locations and activities.Matches generally last only a few minutes.Teamwork and cooperation is encouraged in Siege, and players need to take advantage of their different abilities in order to complete the objective and defeat the enemy team.Communication between players is also encouraged.The game also has a spectator mode, which allows players to observe a match from different angles.</p>
